# clicky-game

                                        Overview
* - This app is a memory game with React. This project required me to break up my application's UI into components, manage component state, and respond to user events.

- The application should render different images to the screen. Each image should listen for click events.

- The application should keep track of the user's score. The user's score should be incremented when clicking an image for the first time. The user's score should be reset to 0 if they click the same image more than once.

- Every time an image is clicked, the images rendered to the page should shuffle themselves in a random order.

- Once the user's score is reset after an incorrect guess, the game should restart once page get relod.
